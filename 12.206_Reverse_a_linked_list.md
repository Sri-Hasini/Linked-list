## Question
## Easy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(78 %)
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
## Examples
1. **Sample**<br>
    - Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    - Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
      
2. **Sample**<br>
    - Input: head = [1,2]
    - Output: [2,1]

3. **Sample**<br>
    - Input: head = []
    - Output: []
## Approach :
** Reverse Links in place (Iterative)**

- The previous approach of keeping in stacks and then retriving uses O(N) addition space which can be avoided by interchanging the connecting links of the nodes of the linked list in place.
- The main idea is to flip the order of connections in the linked list, which changes the direction of the arrows.
- When this happens, the last element becomes the new first element of the list. This in-place reversal allows us to efficiently transform the original list without using extra space.

## Algorithm:
**Step 1:** Initialise a ‘temp’ pointer at the head of the linked list. This pointer will be used to traverse the linked list. And initialize the pointer ‘prev’ to ‘NULL’ to keep track of the previous node. This will be used to reverse the direction of the ‘next’ pointers.

**Step 2:** Traverse the entire linked list by moving through each node using the 'temp' pointer until it reaches the end (marked as 'NULL').
At each iteration within the traversal,Save the reference to the next node that 'temp' is pointing to in a variable called 'front'. This helps retain the link to the subsequent node before altering the 'next' pointer.
Reverse the direction of the ‘next’ pointer of the current node (pointed to by ‘temp’) to point to the ‘prev’ node. This effectively reversed the direction of the linked list, making the current node point to the previous node. 
Move the ‘prev’ pointer to the current node. This sets up the ‘prev’ pointer for the next iteration of the loop.
Move the ‘temp’ pointer to the ‘front’ node. This advances the traversal to the next node in the original order.

**Step 3:** Keep traversing through the linked list using the 'temp' pointer until it reaches the end, thereby reversing the entire list. Once the 'temp' pointer reaches the end, return the new head of the reversed linked list, which is now indicated by the 'prev' pointer. This 'prev' pointer becomes the first node in the newly reversed list.

## Code in cpp :
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        //Just reversed the connections
        ListNode * temp = head;//initially store head in temp for traversing
        ListNode * prev = nullptr;//keep prev as null initially inorder to assign to the first node
        while (temp) {//iterate until temp reaches end i.e., nullptr
            ListNode *front = temp->next;//create front node as next node
            temp->next = prev;//keep next of the current node to prev to change the direction
            prev = temp;//keep prev as temp as we should consider current temp as prev for the next node
            temp = front;//update temp as front, because if we move temp to next, then we will go back as we have changed the connections, so thats why we stored this value in front, so assign front here
        }
        return prev;
    }
};
```
