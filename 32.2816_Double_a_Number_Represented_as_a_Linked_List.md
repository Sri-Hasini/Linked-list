- [Problem link from Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/double-a-number-represented-as-a-linked-list/description/)
## Question
## [Medium] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(61 %)
You are given the head of a non-empty linked list representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes.
Return the head of the linked list after doubling it.
## Example:
**1. Sample:**
      - Input: head = [1,8,9]
      - Output: [3,7,8]
      - Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 189. Hence, the returned linked list represents the number 189 * 2 = 378.

**2. Sample:**
      - Input: head = [9,9,9]
      - Output: [1,9,9,8]
      - Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 999. Hence, the returned linked list reprersents the number 999 * 2 = 1998. 
 
## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10<sup>4</sup>]
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9
- The input is generated such that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros, except the number 0 itself.

## Approach:
- If we do with basic brute force method like just taking the values from the linked list and forming a number from it
- Then, if we multiply it by 2 and again store it by creating a dummy linked list, then it may pass 90% of testcases
- But it will definitely fail for larger length linked list as the length of the linked list given in the constraints are big
- So, We need to do in another approach
- We need to reverse the linked list and then take out each value from it and multiply it with 2, and also store if any carry is generated
- Just like how we do a normal math multiplication
Eg :  <pre> 
  1   1 1
  9 9 1 8 7
     x    2
  ---------
  9 8 2 7 4
  ---------
  </pre>
