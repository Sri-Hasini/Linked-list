# 2816. Double a Number Represented as a Linked List
- [Problem link from Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/double-a-number-represented-as-a-linked-list/description/)
## Question
## [Medium] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(61 %)
You are given the head of a non-empty linked list representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes.
Return the head of the linked list after doubling it.
## Example:
**1. Sample:**

      - Input: head = [1,8,9]
      - Output: [3,7,8]
      - Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 189. 
        Hence, the returned linked list represents the number 189 * 2 = 378.

**2. Sample:**

      - Input: head = [9,9,9]
      - Output: [1,9,9,8]
      - Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 999. 
        Hence, the returned linked list reprersents the number 999 * 2 = 1998. 
 
## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10<sup>4</sup>]
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9
- The input is generated such that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros, except the number 0 itself.

## Approach:
- If we do with basic brute force method like just taking the values from the linked list and forming a number from it
- Then, if we multiply it by 2 and again store it by creating a dummy linked list, then it may pass 90% of testcases
- But it will definitely fail for larger length linked list as the length of the linked list given in the constraints are big
- So, We need to do in another approach
- We need to reverse the linked list and then take out each value from it and multiply it with 2, and also store if any carry is generated
- Just like how we do a normal math multiplication
<br>Eg :  <pre>
  1   1 1
  9 9 1 8 7
      x    2
  **---------**
  9 8 2 7 4
  **---------**
  </pre>
- Do this process and update the dummy linked list by connecting ending of it to the newly created node and moving it to next
- Also move our temp to next and finally if there is any extra carry left, also create a node with that and add to the dummy linked list
- Return reverse of the generated dummy linkedlist's next

## Code in cpp:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode * rev(ListNode * head) {
        if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) return head;
        ListNode * newhead = rev(head->next);
        ListNode * front = head->next;
        front->next = head;
        head->next = nullptr;
        return newhead;
    }
    ListNode* doubleIt(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == nullptr) return head;
        head = rev(head);
        ListNode * temp = head;
        ListNode * dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode * dum = dummy;
        int carry = 0;
        bool z = true;
        while (temp) {
            int value = temp->val * 2 + carry;
            if (value > 9) {
                int temp = value % 10;
                value /= 10; 
                swap(temp, value);
                carry = temp;
                z = false;
            }
            dum->next = new ListNode(value);
            dum = dum->next;
            temp = temp->next;
            if (z) {
                carry = 0;
            }
            z = true;
        }
        if (carry != 0) {
            dum->next = new ListNode(carry);
            dum = dum->next;
        }
        dum->next = nullptr;
        return rev(dummy->next);
    }
};
```
