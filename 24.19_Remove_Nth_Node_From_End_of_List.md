## Question
## [Medium] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(48 %)
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
## Examples :
1. **Sample :**<br>
    - Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
    - Output: [1,2,3,5]

2. **Sample :**<br>
    - Input: head = [1], n = 1
    - Output: []

3. **Sample :**<br>
    - Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
    - Output: [1]
## Approach :
To enhance efficiency, we will involve two pointers, a fast pointer and a slow pointer. The fast-moving pointer will initially be exactly N nodes ahead of the slow-moving pointer. 
After which, both of them will move one step at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the last node, i.e., the L-th node, the slow is guaranteed to be at the (L-N)-th node, where L is the total length of the linked list.
## Algorithm
1. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to the head of the linked list. Initially, only fast will move till it crosses N nodes, after which both of the pointers will move simultaneously.
2. Traverse the linked list till the fast pointer reaches the last node, that is, the Lth Node, at this stage, the slow pointer is guaranteed to be at the (L-N)th node.
3. Point this slow pointer to the (L-N+2)th node, effectively skipping the Nth node from the end or the (L-N+1)th node from the start.
4. Finally, free up the space occupied by this to delete it.

Note: In the case of languages like Java, Python, and Javascript, there is no need for the deletion of objects or nodes because these have an automatic garbage collection mechanism that automatically identifies and reclaims memory that is no longer in use.

```cpp
/**

 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        //used 
        ListNode * slow = head, * fast = head;
        int n1 = n;
        while (n1-- && fast) {
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        if (fast == nullptr) {
            head = head->next;
            return head;
        }
        ListNode * prev = nullptr;
        while (fast) {
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        if (prev && slow)
        prev->next = slow->next;
        if (!slow) return slow;
        delete slow;
        return head;
    }
};
```
