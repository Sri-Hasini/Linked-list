## Question
## [Medium] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(61 %)
Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.
The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.
Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.
## Examples :
1. **Sample :**<br>
    - Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    - Output: [1,3,5,2,4]

2. **Sample :**<br>
    - Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
    - Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
## Approach :
1. Initialize pointers:
      - odd: Points to the current odd-indexed node.
      - even: Points to the current even-indexed node.
      - temp: Stores the head of the even-indexed portion of the list.
2. Traverse the list:
      - While even is not null and even->next is not null:
        - Update odd->next to skip the next odd-indexed node (i.e., odd->next = odd->next->next).
        - Update even->next to skip the next even-indexed node (i.e., even->next = even->next->next).
        - Move odd and even pointers to their next nodes.
3. Connect the odd and even portions:
      - Set odd->next to temp, which links the odd-indexed portion to the even-indexed portion.
4. Return the modified head of the list.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* oddEvenList(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) return head;//edge case 
        ListNode * odd = head;//to process for odd nodes
        ListNode * even = head->next;//to process for even nodes
        ListNode * temp = even;//to store the even nodes starting point
        while (even && even->next) {
            //update odd and even pointers to skip one node each
            odd->next = odd->next->next;//skipping even nodes
            even->next = even->next->next;//skipping odd nodes
            odd = odd->next;//moving one step
            even = even->next;//moving one step
        }
        odd->next = temp;//connect them both 
        return head;//and return head
    }
};
```
