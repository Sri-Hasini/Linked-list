## Question
## [Medium] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(54 %)
Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. 
Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). 
It is -1 if there is no cycle. 
Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
Do not modify the linked list.
## Examples
1) **Sample:**<br>
    - Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
    - Output: tail connects to node index 1
    - Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

2) **Sample:**<br>
    - Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
    - Output: tail connects to node index 0
    - Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

3) **Sample:**<br>
    - Input: head = [1], pos = -1
    - Output: no cycle
    - Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        //Using Floyd's cycle detection algorithm
        ListNode* slow = head;//set slow pointer to head
        ListNode* fast = head;//set fast pointer to head
        //iterate until fast pointer not equals to NULL and fast->next not equals to NULL
        while (fast && fast->next) {  
            slow = slow->next;//make one step with slow pointer
            fast = fast->next->next;//make two steps with fast pointer
            if (slow == fast) break;//break when slow pointer and fast pointer meet
        }
        if (!fast || !fast->next) return nullptr;//return nullptr if, fast or fast->next reaches nullptr
        fast = head;//keep fast as head now
        while (fast != slow) {//iterate until they both meet
            fast = fast->next;//take one step by fast pointer
            slow = slow->next;//take one step by slow pointer
        }
        return slow;//return slow pointer or fast pointer (as they both are same now)      
    }
};
