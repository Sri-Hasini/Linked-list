# 2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros
- [Problem from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-nodes-in-between-zeros/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=linked-list)
## Question 
## [Medium] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(89 %)
You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. The beginning and end of the linked list will have Node.val == 0.

For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0's.

Return the head of the modified linked list.
## Example
1. **Sample**<br>

        - Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
        - Output: [4,11]
        - Explanation: The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
            - The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
            - The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.

2. **Sample**<br>

        - Input: head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]
        - Output: [1,3,4]
        - Explanation: The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
            - The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.
            - The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.
            - The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.

 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeNodes(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode * temp1 = head, * temp2 = head->next;
        int sum = 0;
        while (temp2) {
            if (temp2->val != 0) {
                sum += temp2->val;
            }
            else {
                temp1->val = sum;
                if (temp2->next == nullptr) {
                    temp1->next = nullptr;
                }
                else {
                    temp1->next = temp2;
                    temp1 = temp1->next;
                    sum = 0;
                }
            }
            temp2 = temp2->next;
        }
        return head;
    }
};
