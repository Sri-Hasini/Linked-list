## Question
## Easy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(44 %)
Given the head of a linked list, determine whether the list contains a loop. 
If a loop is present, return the number of nodes in the loop, otherwise return 0.

Note: 'c' is the position of the node which is the next pointer of the last node of the linkedlist. If c is 0, then there is no loop.
## Example
1. **Sample :**
    - Input: LinkedList: 25->14->19->33->10->21->39->90->58->45, c = 4
    - Output: 7
    - Explanation: The loop is from 33 to 45. So length of loop is 33->10->21->39-> 90->58->45 = 7. 
      The number 33 is connected to the last node of the linkedlist to form the loop because according to the input the 4th node from the beginning(1 based indexing) will be connected to the last node for the loop.

2. **Sample :**
    - Input: LinkedList: 5->4, c = 0
    - Output: 0
    - Explanation: There is no loop.

## Approach :
**Tortoise and Hare Algorithm.**<br>
The previous method uses O(N) additional memory. To enhance efficiency, the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm is introduced as an optimization.
## Algorithm :
**Step 1:** 
        
        - Initialise two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to the head of the linked list. `slow` will advance one step at a time, while `fast` will advance two steps at a time. These pointers will move simultaneously.
        
**Step 2:** 

        - Traverse the linked list with the `slow` and `fast` pointers. While traversing, repeatedly move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps at a time.
        
**Step 3:** 

    - Continue this traversal until one of the following conditions is met:
        - `fast` or `fast.next` reaches the end of the linked list (i.e., becomes null). In this case, there is no loop in the linked list hence it is linear, and the algorithm terminates by returning 0.
        - `fast` and `slow` pointers meet at the same node. This indicates the presence of a loop in the linked list as we have seen in the detection of loop.<br>
        - This is the point where the slow and fast have met proving that there is a loop in the linked list. From here onwards we start counting for the length of this loop.
        
**Step 4:** 
        - Initialise a counter with zero and traverse the linked list using the `fast` pointer again, but this time only move one step at a time while incrementing the counter with each node visited. As the fast pointer reaches back at the slow pointer, the value of the counter will represent the length of the loop.
