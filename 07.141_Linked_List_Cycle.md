## Question
## Medium &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(51 %)
Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. 
Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. 
Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

## Approach 
- Created a slow pointer and fast pointer assigning them as head
- We run a loop until the fast or fast->next becomes NULL
- We will make one step with slow pointer and 2 steps with fast pointer at a time
- If they both are equal, then we can return true representing that there is a loop
- Otherwise we can return false
  
## How does Floyd’s slow and fast pointers approach work?
The algorithm is to start two pointers slow and fast from the head of the linked list. We move slow one node at a time and fast two nodes at a time. If there is a loop, then they will definitely meet.

This approach works because of the following facts :
- When slow pointer enters the loop, the fast pointer must be inside the loop. 
- if we consider movements of slow and fast pointers, we can notice that distance between them (from slow to fast) increase by one after every iteration.

After each iteration where the slow pointer moves one step forward and the fast pointer moves two steps forward, the distance between the two pointers increases. Initially, if the slow pointer is at a distance k from a certain point in the cycle, then after one iteration, the distance between the slow and fast pointers becomes k+1. After two iterations, this distance becomes k+2 and so on. As they continue to move within the cycle, this distance will eventually equal the cycle length n. At this point, since the distance wraps around the cycle and both pointers are moving within the same cycle, they will meet.

**Finding the Start of the Cycle :**

Once the slow and fast pointers meet within the loop, the next step is to identify the start of the cycle. To do this, we reset one of the pointers – let’s say the slow pointer to the head of the linked list. The other pointer, the fast pointer, remains at the point where the two pointers initially met. Both pointers are then moved one node at a time. As they traverse the list, the pointer that was reset to the head will cover the distance m to the start of the loop. Since the total distance m + k covered by the slow pointer is a multiple of the cycle length n, both pointers will eventually converge at the start of the cycle. This simultaneous movement ensures that the pointer starting from the head meets the pointer at the start of the cycle, there by successfully identifying the beginning of the loop.

Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm is efficient in detecting loops in a linked list with a time complexity O(n) and space complexity of O(1).
## Code in cpp
```cpp
 /**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode * slow = head;//kept slow pointer as head
        ListNode * fast = head;//kept fast pointer as head
        while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {//we run this until our fast and fast->next not equals nullptr
            slow = slow->next;//takes one step
            fast = fast->next->next;//takes two steps
            if (slow == fast) {//if they are equal it means a cycle exits
                return true;//so return true
            }
        }
        return false;//or else return false;
    }
};
```
