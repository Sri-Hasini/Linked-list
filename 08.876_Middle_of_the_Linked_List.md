## Question
## Easy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(80%)
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## Example
1.Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]<br>
  Output: [3,4,5]<br>
  Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

2. Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]<br>
  Output: [4,5,6]<br>
  Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

## Approach
- We used Fast/Slow pointer technique when slow moves once while fast pointer moves twice
- At the time the fast pointer becomes NULL or its next becomes NULL, we can stop the loop
- we can just return slow pointer, because this will probably be at the middle
  
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode * slow = head;//create a slow pointer as head
        ListNode * fast = head;//create a fast pointer as head
        while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {//iterate until fast or fast->next become nullptr
            slow = slow->next;//iterate slow by taking one step
            fast = fast->next->next;//make two steps at a time
        }
        return slow;//return slow pointer, because this will be at the middle
    }
};
```
