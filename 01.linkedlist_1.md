## Description
- It is a linear data structure that can be visualized as a chain with different nodes connected, where each node represents a different element.
- The difference between arrays and linked lists is that, unlike arrays, the elements are not stored at a contiguous location.
- Since for any element to be added in an array, we need the exact next memory location to be empty, and it is impossible to guarantee that it is possible. 
- Hence adding elements to an array is not possible after the initial assignment of size.
- A linked list is a data structure containing two crucial pieces of information, the first being the data and the other being the pointer to the next element. 
- The ‘head’ is the first node, and the ‘tail’ is the last node in a linked list.
- There are two information sets to store at every node, thus there is a need to create a self-defined data type to handle them. Therefore, we will use the help of structs and classes.
```cpp
class Node{
    Public: // access modifier
    int data; // the data value
    Node* next; // the pointer to the next value
    Public:
    // constructor
    Node (int data1, Node* next1){
        data=data1;  // Initialize data with the provided value
        next=next1;  // Initialize next with the provided
    }
    Node (int data1){
        data=data1;  // Initialize data with the provided value
        next=nullptr;  // Initialize next as null since it's the end of the list

    }
};
int main(){
    vector<int> arr={2,5,8,7};
    Node* y= new Node(arr[0]);
    cout<<y<<'\n'; // returns the memory value
    cout<<y->data<<'\n'; // returns the data stored at that memory point
}
```
**Output:**

Let's break this example to understand how it works:
- The struct has two data types: data which contains the value of the node and a pointer next, which points to the next node in the list.
- There is a constructor which assigns the values to a new node.
- A new keyword is used to dynamically allocate memory to a node with data as arr[0].
The combination of the given parameters and functions initializes a linked list.

<pre><big><b>Understanding Pointers :</b></big>
- A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. 
- In simpler terms, it "points" to the location in memory where data is stored. 
- This allows you to indirectly access and manipulate data by referring to its memory address.</pre>

**Note :**
- Java does not explicitly use pointers or take the address of variables as you do in C++. Instead, we have reference variables. 
- These reference variables do not directly contain memory addresses like pointers in languages such as C or C++. Instead, they hold references to objects in memory.
  
<big><b>Understanding the difference between Node and Node*:</b></big><br>
A node refers to the structure that contains data and the pointer to the next node. 
In contrast, Node* (Node pointer) specifically denotes a pointer variable that stores the address of the Node it is pointing to.

## Applications of Linked Lists:
- Creating Data Structures: Linked lists serve as the foundation for building other dynamic data structures, such as stacks and queues.
- Dynamic Memory Allocation: Dynamic memory allocation relies on linked lists to manage and allocate memory blocks efficiently.
- Web Browser is one important application of Linked List.
- In dynamic memory allocation linked lists are used to keep track of free and allocated memory blocks.
- Linked lists are used in text editors to implement undo and redo operations.
- Linked lists are used to implement adjacency lists for the graph data structures.
- Linked lists are also used to implement fundamental data structures like stack and queue.

## Types of Linked Lists:
1. **Singly Linked Lists:** In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the sequence and last node containing NULL.
   The singly linked list is the simplest form of linked list in which the node contain two members data and a next pointer that stores the address of the next node.
   Traversal is straightforward but limited to moving in one direction, from the head to the tail. 

2. **Doubly Linked Lists:** In this each node points to both the next node and the previous node, thus allowing it for bidirectional connectivity.
   The doubly linked list is the modified version of the singly linked list where each node of the doubly linked consists of three data members data ,next and prev.
   The prev is a pointer that stores the address of the previous node in the linked list sequence.
   Each node in a doubly linked list except the first and the last node is connected with each other through the prev and next pointer.
   The prev pointer of the first node and the next pointer of the last node points to NULL in the doubly linked list.

3. **Circular Linked Lists:** In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the head node, forming a closed loop.
   The circular linked list is almost same as the singly linked list but with a small change.
   In a circular linked list the next pointer of the last node points to the first node of the linked list rather than pointing to NULL, this makes this data structure circular in nature which is used in various applications like media players. 

4. **Doubly Circular Linked List:** The doubly circular linked list is a combination of a doubly linked list and a circular linked list.
   In a doubly circular linked list the prev pointer of the first node points to the last node and the next pointer of the last node points to the first node.
   The main advantage of a doubly circular linked list is that we can access the last node of the linked list in constant time through the first node.

## Approach:
- Define a structure Node having two members data and a next pointer. The data will store the value of the node and the next pointer will store the address of the next node in the sequence.
- For doubly linked list you will have to add an addition pointer prev that will store the address of the prev node in the sequence.
- Define a class LinkedList consisting of all the member functions for the LinkedList and a head pointer that will store the reference of a particular linked list.
- Initialize the head to NULL as the linked list is empty initially.
- Representation of a Node in the Linked List
- Each node of the linked list will be represented as a structure having two members data and next where:
  1. Data: Represents the value stored in the node.
  2. Next Pointer: Stores the reference to the next node in the sequence.
      ```cpp
      struct Node {    
                int data;    
                Node* next;
      };
      ```
- Implement basic functions like insertAtBeginning, insertAtEnd, deleteFromBeginning, deleteFromEnd that will manipulate the elements of the linked list.
