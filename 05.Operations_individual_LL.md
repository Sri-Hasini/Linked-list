# Performing operations individually
## 1. Inserting a node at the end of the linked list
```cpp
//there is no need to pass the head actually
//we can directly write it as a void functiona and only pass value 
//as a parameter
//like : void insert(int val)
 Node * insert_end(Node * head, int val) {
    Node * temp = new Node(val);
    if (head == nullptr) {
        head = tail = temp;
    }
    else {
        tail->next = temp;
        tail = temp;
    }
    return head;
}
```
## 2. Inserting a node at the beginning of the linked list
```cpp
//Inserting a node at the beginning that means head
Node * insert_head(Node * head, int val) {
    Node * temp = new Node(val, head);//create a temporary node and pass it with data and the next value too
    head = temp;//keep head as temp and return it
    return head;
}
```

## 3. Inserting a node at a given position 
```cpp
//insert a value at a given position
Node * insert_position(Node * head, int val, int k) {
    if (head == NULL) {//if it is empty
        if (k == 1) {//and if k is given as 1
            Node * temp = new Node(val);// we can create a node with this value 
            head = tail = temp;//keep head and tail as this node
            return head;//we can return head
        }
        return head;
        //otherwise there as there is no option in this scenerio if it is given another k value, we will return head directly
    }
    if (k == 1) {//if k is given as 1, that means to insert at the head / beginning
        Node * temp = new Node(val, head);//create a node with the value pointing the next of it to the head
        head = temp;//update head as temp and return
        return head;
    }
    int cnt = 0;
    Node * temp = head;//create a temp node 
    while (temp) {//iterates until it becomes null
        cnt++;//represents the position
        if (cnt == k - 1) {//if it is one position before the required
            Node * cur = new Node(val);//create a current node with the given value
            cur->next = temp->next;//keep a connection for the current node and the next node first
            temp->next = cur;//next create connection with the previous node
            break;//break it 
        }
        temp = temp->next;//or else just move your temp to next
    }
    return head;//return the head
}
```

## 4. Inserting element before a given value
```cpp
//inserting element before a given value
        Node * insert_before_value(Node * head, int el, int val) {
            if (head == NULL) {
            //it is not at all possible, if the LL is empty, because they asked us to insert before given value, there is no value at all
                return head;
            }
            if (head->data == val) {//if our required value equals head's data, then we can keep our new element at the head
                Node * temp = new Node(el, head);//created a new node with element and next as head
                head = temp;//keep o0ur temp as head
                return head;//we can now return the head
            }
            Node * temp = head;//create a temp node 
            while (temp->next) {//iterate it until last but one node
                if (temp->next->data == val) {//check if our next nodes value equals our desired value
                    Node * cur = new Node(el, temp->next);//if yes, create a new node as cur and keep the element as data and temp->next as next 
                    temp->next = cur;//keep temp's next as the current node
                    break;//break it
                }
                temp = temp->next;//or else just iterate temp to next
            }
            return head;//return head
        }
```

## 5. Deleting a node from the beginning
```cpp
//Delete a node from the beginning
Node * delete_head(Node * head) {
    if (head == NULL) return head;//if empty return head directly
    if (head == tail) {
        free(tail);//if have only one element, we can free head or tail
        head = tail = NULL;//assign it to null
        return head;//return head
    }
    Node *temp = head;//otherwise create a temporary node
    head = head->next;//keep the head as the 1st element (inorder to remove connection fromt that previous head node)
    delete temp;//delete the temporary node(which contains head)
    return head;//return head
}
```

## 6. Deleting a node from the end
```cpp
//delete a node from the end
Node * delete_end(Node * head) {
    if (head == NULL) return head;//if LL is empty, can return head directly
    else if (head->next == NULL) {//if has only one node, or we can also check for (head == tail)
        free(tail);//we can free head or tail 
        head = tail = NULL;//keep both head and tail to null
        return head;//return the head
    }
    else {
        Node *temp = head;//or else we can create a temporary node and assign head to it
        while (temp->next->next) {//iterate until the 2nd last element
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        free(temp->next);//free the last node 
        temp->next = NULL;//so, the last node is now the previous node (2nd last will be last now), point it's next to null
    }
    return head;//return head
}
```

## 7. Deleting a node from any position
```cpp
//delete a node from the kth position
Node * delete_position(Node * head, int k) {
    if (head == NULL) return head;// if it is null, it represents that LL is empty and we can directly return it
    if (k == 1) {//it means we need to remove the head 
        Node * temp = head;
        head = head->next;
        delete temp;
        return head;
    }
    int cnt = 0;//for counting the positions
    Node * temp = head, * prev = nullptr;//temporary node for traversing and previous node for keeping track of the previous node
    while (temp) {
        cnt++;//increment cnt value for every iteration denoting position
        if (cnt == k) {//if it is equal to the given k value
            prev->next = prev->next->next;
//we keep previous node's next as current node's next (nothing but (prev->next) denotes current and ->next denotes its next)
            free(temp);//free the temp which is the current kth node
            break;//we can stop the loop , so break it
        }
        prev = temp;//we always keep track of the previous node here
        temp = temp->next;//this represents the current node
    }
    return head;
}
```

## 8. Delete a node with the given element
```cpp
//delete a node with the given element
Node * delete_value(Node * head, int val) {
    if (head == NULL) return head;//if head is null, then it seems like there will be no elements in it, so we can return it direclty
    if (head->data == val) {//if our 1st element is the one which we need to delete, we can check it directly using head->data == val
        Node * temp = head;//create a temporary node by assigning head to it
        head = head->next;// move head to the next element
        delete temp;//delete temporary node (which is nothing but previous head)
        return head;//return head
    }
    Node * temp = head, * prev = nullptr;
    while (temp) {//runs until temp becomes null
        if (temp->data == val) {//if our current node's data is equal to the given value
            prev->next = prev->next->next;
//we can remove the connection with it from prev node, like keeping the previous node's next as current nodes next
            delete temp;//we can delete the current node
            break;//break the loop, as they only asked to remove one node which matches the value
        }
        prev = temp;//keep track of the previous node 
        temp = temp->next;//represents the current node
    }
    return head;
}
```

## 9. Display
```cpp
//display the elements in the linked list
void display(Node * head) {
    Node * temp = head;//create a temporary node assign the head
    while (temp) {//iterate until it becomes null
        cout << temp->data << " ";//print the data
        temp = temp->next;
    }
}
```
