# 2487. Remove Nodes From Linked List
- [Problem link from Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nodes-from-linked-list/description/)
## Question
## [Medium] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(74 %)
You are given the head of a linked list.
Remove every node which has a node with a greater value anywhere to the right side of it.
Return the head of the modified linked list.
## Example:
**1. Sample:**

      - Input: head = [5,2,13,3,8]
      - Output: [13,8]
      - Explanation: The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2 and 3.
          - Node 13 is to the right of node 5.
          - Node 13 is to the right of node 2.
          - Node 8 is to the right of node 3.

**2. Sample:**

      - Input: head = [1,1,1,1]
      - Output: [1,1,1,1]
      - Explanation: Every node has value 1, so no nodes are removed.
 
## Constraints:
- The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [1, 105].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 105

## Approach:
- We will reverse the linked list and then we will take the maximum element upto that index into a vector
- Reverse the vector and reverse the linked list too, so it means for 0th index, it will say the next maximum value, for next and so on
- Means for every index, it will say which is the maximum element towards right of it including itself
- After doing above things, iterate over the linked list from starting and if our current value in vector equals to that of current node in linked list
- Then, add that to the dummy header and move dummy node's next towards next, increment i value (index representing the vector)
- And move the temp to next (representing the linked list current node)
- Keep the final dummy nodes next as nullptr and then return the dummy headers next 

## Code in cpp:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode * rev(ListNode * head) {
        if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) return head;
        ListNode * newhead = rev(head->next);
        ListNode * front = head->next;
        front->next = head;
        head->next = nullptr;
        return newhead;
    }
    ListNode* removeNodes(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) return head;
        head = rev(head);
        ListNode * temp = head;
        vector <int> s;
        int maxi = 0;
        while (temp) {
            maxi = max(temp->val, maxi);
            s.push_back(maxi);
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
        head = rev(head);
        temp = head;
        int i = 0;
        ListNode * dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode * dum = dummy;
        while (temp) {
            if (temp->val == s[i]) {
                dum->next = new ListNode(s[i]);
                dum = dum->next;
            }
            i++;
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        dum->next = nullptr;
        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```
